# Add

The add function is used to add a new entry to your database. You provide the necessary data as input to the function
and it returns a promise that resolves to the inserted object, including its `id`, or rejects with an error if there 
was a problem adding the entry to the database.

## Usage example

The next code sample shows how to use the add function to add a new entry to the database.

<Playground code={StoryCode} availableImports={{ ...commonExports, '~/data/customer/add': add }} height="320px" />
