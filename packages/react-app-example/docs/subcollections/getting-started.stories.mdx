## Subcollections

In Firestore, subcollections are a way of organizing data under a specific document in a collection. The Firestore TypeScript Client Builder supports this feature by allowing you to define subcollections within an entity in your data model. 

Here is an example of how you can define a subcollection:

```javascript
createClientDataLayer({
    metadata: {
        entities: {
            driver: {
                properties: {
                    name: { type: 'string', isRequired: true },
                    dob: { type: 'date', isNullable: true },
                },
                subcollections: {
                    car: {
                        properties: {
                            name: { type: 'string', isRequired: true },
                            model: { type: 'string', isRequired: true },
                        },
                    },
                },
            },
        },
    },
});
```
In this example, the `driver` collection has a subcollection `car`. Each `car` is associated with a specific `driver` and has properties `name` and `model`.

### File Structure for Subcollections

When a data model with subcollections is provided, the Firestore TypeScript Client Builder generates the appropriate TypeScript files in the specified directory. For subcollections, the files are generated in a nested directory within the parent entity directory. For example, for the `car` subcollection of the `driver` entity, the files are generated at `~data/driver/car/`.

The generated files for a subcollection include all the services methods and hooks that a top-level collection has, with the key difference being the methods to access, write, or read data require the parent entity's ID to reach the subcollection in Firestore.

### Using Subcollection Entities in TypeScript

You can use the generated TypeScript code for subcollections in the same way as for top-level collections. Here's an example of how you can use the `car` subcollection in a React component:

```javascript
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { limit, query } from 'firebase/firestore';
import { Table, Column } from 'react-rainbow-components';
import listCars from '~/data/driver/car/list';
import { Car } from '~/data/driver/car/types';

const driverId = 'cVpvbSDxeXn02RJo4ya0';

const List = () => {
    const [cars, setCars] = useState<Car[]>([]);

    useEffect(() => {
        (async () => {
            const carList = await listCars(driverId, {
                listQueryFn: (ref) => query(ref, limit(10)),
            });
            setCars(carList);
        })();
    }, []);

    return (
        <Table keyField="id" data={cars}>
            <Column header="Id" field="id" />
            <Column header="Name" field="name" />
            <Column header="Model" field="model" />
        </Table>
    );
};
```

In this example, the `listCars` function imported from the generated TypeScript code is used to get a list of `Car` entities from the `car` subcollection of the `driver` with the provided `driverId`. The resulting list is then displayed in a table.

Remember to always provide the parent entity's ID when accessing a subcollection. This is necessary because the subcollection is located under the parent document in Firestore.
