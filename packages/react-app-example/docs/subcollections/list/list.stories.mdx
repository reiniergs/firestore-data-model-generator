## Working with Subcollections
In this live example, we demonstrate how to utilize a subcollection in a React component using the Firestore TypeScript Client Builder.

We will be interacting with the 'car' subcollection under a 'driver' entity. The aim is to list all the cars associated with a particular driver. The driver's ID is pre-defined as 'cVpvbSDxeXn02RJo4ya0'.

## Example usage

<Playground
    code={StoryCode}
    availableImports={{ 
        ...commonExports,
        '~/data/driver/car/list': list,
    }}
    height="500px" />
